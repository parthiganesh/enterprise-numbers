# SNMP sysObjectID
snmp-sysObjectID is a Node.js module that allows you to retrieve the device vendor, category, and model from a given SNMP sysObjectID. It also provides organization name for the given private enterprise number.

The Private Enterprise Number (PEN) is a unique identifier assigned to each enterprise by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). By using the PEN, you can determine the vendor of any SNMP-enabled device and the sources of NetFlow data generated by the device.

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) sysObjectID is an object identifier (OID) that is used to identify the type of device or system being managed. The sysObjectID is part of the SNMP system group and is a unique identifier that is assigned by the vendor or manufacturer of the device or system. It provides valuable information for network management systems to identify and monitor network devices and their capabilities.

The OID (Object Identifier) to get sysObjectID is ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2". This is part of the SNMP MIB-II system group and is used to retrieve the OID of the device's sysObjectID. The value of sysObjectID uniquely identifies the type of device and the vendor that manufactured it.

```

## Functions

`getDeviceInfo(oid: string, default_value?: string): SysInfo`

This function retrieves the device vendor, category, and model from the given SNMP sysObjectID. If the device information is not available, it returns default value for each field.

 * oid (required) - The SNMP sysObjectID of the device.
 * default_value (optional) - The default value to be returned for category and model if the device information is not available.

Returns an object containing the vendor, category, and model of the device.

`getOrg(Id: number | string): string`

This function retrieves the name of the organization that owns the given enterprise number.

 * Id (required) - The enterprise number of the organization or the SNMP sysObjectID of the device.
